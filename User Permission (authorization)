In this Skills Session , we`ll learn how to make our Website access secure by applying Password Security for access the Website

When open website username and password will be asked to open the website else unable to access the website

Step 1st
Open httpd.conf file exists in wamp/bin/apache/apache2.4.23/conf/httpd.conf

Write code as below at the end of the file

AccessFileName htaccess.acl .htaccess
<Directory "c:/wamp64/www/basicAuth/">
  Options None
  AllowOverride All
  Order Deny,Allow
</Directory>

#basicAuth is the folder or website area that you wants to secure 

Save the changes 

Step 2nd
Open command Prompt as Administrator 

write cd C:/wamp/bin/apache/apache2.4.23/bin (press enter)
then write htpasswd -c pwd.txt username (press enter)
then the password will be prompt set any secure password for username

pwd.txt is the file created in the area C:/wamp/bin/apache/apache2.4.23/bin
you can also give any other file name like access.txt

Step 3rd

Open the basicAuth folder , every developer knows that website folder was put in www/ area of wamp/ folder

Create the file with the name htaccess and extension .acl ...
like htaccess.acl
and write following line in that file

AuthUserFile C:\wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.2.11\bin\pwd.txt 
AuthName "Protected" 
AuthType Basic
<Limit GET POST> 
require valid-user 
</Limit>

Save the changes

Restart the wamp Server and run the website 
localhost/basicAuth
Username and Password window will be asked if the user typed correctly, then website will be opened else not ...

localhost can be opened , its not secured , only basicAuth is secured
