Step 1st 
Go to c:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
Open hosts file as administrator
# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.

#when u write in address web_crud.com it means u call 127.0.0.1:80 (remember 127.0.0.1 == 127.0.0.1:80 == 127.0.0.1:8080 is same thing)
	127.0.0.1:80    localhost
	127.0.0.1	web_crud.com
	127.0.0.1:71	localhost
	127.0.0.1	xampmain.com
